- `routes`: contains the routes in a txt format. They are listed in positions [row,column], where the first line outlines the dimensions of the grid, e.g. 10x20, and the cells after that until the $ sign are the positions of the blocks. The following lines after that show the cells that the route passes by.
- `grid_based_route_grid`: is code to process the route txt files.
